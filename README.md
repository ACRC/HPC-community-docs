ACRC community HPC documentation: domain-specific information for HPC users

## Description
The HPC community documentation project provides a space for HPC users at the University of Bristol to publish domain-specific information on how to effectively use HPC facilities managed by the [ACRC][acrc-website] at the University of Bristol.

The HPC community documentation is complementary to the [ACRC HPC Documentation and User Guides][acrc-hpc-user-docs]. 
It provides a space for user-contributed specialist documentation relating to particular research areas, for example

* Example job submission scripts for the package
* Running the software efficiently on the HPC facilities 
* Compiling/building the software for the HPC facilities
* Workflows for collecting and analysing of software outputs 
* Workarounds or solutions for commonly encountered problems
