# HPC-community-docs

## Description
The HPC community documentation project provides a space for HPC users at the University of Bristol to publish domain-specific information on how to effectively use HPC facilities managed by the [ACRC][acrc-website] at the University of Bristol.

The HPC community documentation is complementary to the [ACRC HPC Documentation and User Guides][acrc-hpc-user-docs]. 
It provides a space for user-contributed specialist documentation relating to particular research areas, for example

* Example job submission scripts for specialist software packages
* Running specialist software efficiently on the HPC facilities 
* Compiling/building specialist software for the HPC facilities
* Workflows for collecting and analysing of outputs from specialist software
* Workarounds or solutions for commonly encountered problems

## Accessing the documentation
