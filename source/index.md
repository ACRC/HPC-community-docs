# ACRC HPC community documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to the University of Bristol Advanced Computing Research Centre (ACRC) HPC community documentation project!
Here you will find documentation contributed by HPC users at the University of Bristol, providing domain-specific information on how to effectively use HPC facilities managed by the ACRC at the University of Bristol.

For general information and guides related to accessing and using ACRC HPC facilities, please see the [ACRC HPC Documentation and User Guides](https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/protected/hpc-docs/index.html) (University of Bristol login required).

The HPC community documentation is complementary to the ACRC HPC Documentation and User Guides. It provides a space for user-contributed specialist documentation relating to particular research areas. For example, documentation for a research software packages used in particular domain might include:

* Example job submission scripts for the package
* Running the software efficiently on the HPC facilities 
* Compiling/building the software for the HPC facilities
* Workflows for collecting and analysing of software outputs 
* Workarounds or solutions for commonly encountered problems
