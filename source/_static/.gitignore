# Custom static files can be added to _static, to be copied to the _static 
# directory in the HTML output (possibly overwriting the theme's default files).
#
# Paths for static files are set by the value of html_extra_path in the build 
# configuration file (conf.py). Dotfiles (e.g. .gitignore) are never copied.

# This directory must be present in the source tree, even if empty, to prevent 
# sphinx-build emitting a warning (which will result in a failed build when the
#Â -W flag is used with sphinx-build).
